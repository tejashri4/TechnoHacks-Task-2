# Overview of the Project
# Project: Create a To-Do List Application

**Problem Statement:**

The goal is to develop a simple command-line application that allows users to manage their tasks effectively. This application should provide the following core functionalities:

* **Add Tasks:** Users should be able to easily input new tasks they need to accomplish.
* **View Tasks:** The application should display all existing tasks in a clear and organized manner, making it easy for users to see what needs to be done.
* **Remove Tasks:** Users should be able to remove completed tasks or those that are no longer relevant from their list.

**Key Features:**

* **User-friendly Interface:** The application should have a simple and intuitive command-line interface, making it easy for users to navigate and interact with.
* **Data Storage:** The application should effectively store and manage the list of tasks. This could be achieved using various data structures like lists or dictionaries.
* **Core Functionality:** The essential features of adding, viewing, and removing tasks should be implemented correctly and efficiently.

**Possible Enhancements:**

* **Task Prioritization:** Allow users to assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low).
* **Due Dates:** Enable users to set due dates for tasks.
* **Task Editing:** Allow users to edit existing tasks (e.g., change descriptions, update due dates).
* **Task Completion:** Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
* **File I/O:** Implement the ability to save and load task lists from files, allowing users to persist their data.
* **More Advanced Data Structures:** Explore using more sophisticated data structures like dictionaries or custom classes to store and manage task information more effectively.
